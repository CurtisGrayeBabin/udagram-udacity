# Udagram

## Hosting link
The link to the application can be seen [here](http://udagram-hosting.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/home).

## Info
This Udagram application was provided by Udacity. 

The first goal of this final project was to connect Udagram to Amazon Web Services:

- S3 (udagram-frontend) was used for hosting and posts
- Elastic Beanstalk was used for the API (udagram-backend) 
- RDS was used for the `PostgreSQL` database 

The second goal of this project was to connect it with `CircleCI`. Any time this project's main branch is updated then the available application is immediately updated so that users get the latest and greatest features of Udagram.
